# multipleChoiceProject


## Description

A timed, multiple choice game that I designed with an asthetic frontend. It is interactive and educational for those trying to learn Javascript or HTML.I learned several things while building this application such as:
- How to build a Javascript timer
- css techniques
- How to build an interactive interface

## Usage
The game is simple. The time starts when the user clicks the start button and for every wrong point there is a reduction in time (5 seconds) and points. Points are gained when the user answers correctly. There is an input box that allows the user to enter their name or initials so that the current player is known. I did this using local starage. Overall a straight forward game.
